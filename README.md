Problem Statement:

  Zomato is an Indian restaurant aggregator and food delivery start-up founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008. Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants, and also has food delivery options from partner restaurants in select cities.
  India is quite famous for its diverse multi cuisine available in a large number of restaurants and hotel resorts, which is reminiscent of unity in diversity. Restaurant business in India is always evolving. More Indians are warming up to the idea of eating restaurant food whether by dining outside or getting food delivered. The growing number of restaurants in every state of India has been a motivation to inspect the data to get some insights, interesting facts and figures about the Indian food industry in each city. So, this project focuses on analysing the Zomato restaurant data for each city in India.
   The Project focuses on Customers and Company, you have to analyze the sentiments of the reviews given by the customer in the data and made some useful conclusion in the form of Visualizations. Also, cluster the zomato restaurants into different segments. The data is vizualized as it becomes easy to analyse data at instant. The Analysis also solve some of the business cases that can directly help the customers finding the Best restaurant in their locality and for the company to grow up and work on the fields they are currently lagging in.
This could help in clustering the restaurants into segments. Also the data has valuable information around cuisine and costing which can be used in cost vs. benefit analysis
Data could be used for sentiment analysis. Also the metadata of reviewers can be used for identifying the critics in the industry.

Summary of the project :

First I performed data wrangling and preprocessing on the datasets. After that I divided my project into three parts First is to performing exploratory data analysis. Second is to perform clustering on the dataset. Third part is to perform sentimental analysis on the dataset . 

For first part of the project I performed EDA .From EDA I found out that the most preferred cuisines in restaurants is North Indian, Chinese food, continental, Biryani and fast food etc and Customers spending is highest at restaurants named Collage-Hyatt Hyderabad Ghachibowli, Feast Sheraton Hyderabad hotel and 10 Downing street etc. The highest rated restaurants are AB’s –Absolute barbecue,B –Dubs and 3B’s-Buddies,Bar & barbecues. The restaurants are busiest in the month of April, May and July According to the reviewer count .And there are less number of customer in month of January, November and December. 
.
For second part of the project I performed clustering on the datasets. I used k means clustering and hierarchical clustering model to perform clustering. Both of the models has given 5 clusters on the basis of cuisines .The north Indian cuisine and Chinese cuisine is present in all clusters so we can say that these cuisines are most preferred cuisines.
 
For the last part of the project I performed sentimental analysis on zomato restaurants reviews dataset by using three supervised learning models named support vector machine, logistic regression and random forest classifier .Among all the models support vector model has given highest  accuracy of 92% . So we can use the SVM classifier to predict the sentiments of the customers.
